## Chapter 1: The World of Aethelgard

### The Realm's Geography

Aethelgard spans across diverse landscapes, each with its own dangers and wonders.

#### The Northern Frostlands

The frozen wastes of the north are home to ancient ice dragons and resilient frost giants. Here, the aurora borealis dances across the sky, and legends speak of the Frozen Throne, a palace built entirely of enchanted ice where the Winter King once ruled.

##### Major Settlements

- **Frostholm**: The last bastion of civilization in the north, where hardy warriors and fur traders gather around massive hearth fires.
- **Crystal Peak**: A monastery perched atop the highest mountain, where monks study the ways of ice magic.

#### The Central Kingdoms

The heartland of Aethelgard, where most of civilization thrives under the protection of mighty castles and wise rulers.

##### The Kingdom of Valorith

The largest and most prosperous kingdom, ruled by Queen Meridian the Just. The capital, Goldenhaven, is a magnificent city of white stone and golden spires.

##### The Duchy of Shadowmere

A mysterious land shrouded in perpetual mist, ruled by Duke Corvus the Enigmatic. The Veiled City serves as capital, hidden by enchantments.

#### The Southern Deserts

Endless dunes of golden sand hide ancient pyramids and forgotten civilizations. The Sunstone Emirates control the spice and silk trades.

#### The Eastern Forests

Dense woodlands where elven kingdoms have stood for millennia. The Silverleaf Dominion is ruled by the Eternal Council of Seasons.

### The History of Aethelgard

#### The Age of Creation

Long before recorded history, the gods walked the earth. The Celestials championed order and light, while the Netherworlders embraced chaos and darkness. Their conflict shaped reality until they forged the Treaty of Eternity.

#### The First Empire

The earliest human civilization mastered magic and technology beyond modern comprehension. During the Arcane Renaissance, wizards built floating cities and created artificial life. Pride led to the Great Cataclysm, when the Emperor-Mage's ritual to ascend to godhood shattered dimensional boundaries.

#### The Age of Chaos

A thousand-year dark age followed. Dragons emerged to claim dominion over the shattered world. The Twelve Champions eventually united the scattered tribes and led a rebellion against the dragon tyrants.

#### The Age of Kingdoms

The current era, where mortals have reclaimed the world and established new civilizations. An uneasy peace has held for the last century.
